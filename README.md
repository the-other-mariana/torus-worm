# Worm/flower-like Torus

This is a simple script that creates a sine-based torus geometric figure mesh in Autodesk Maya using a bit of math.

## Specifications

Maya version: `Autodesk Maya 2017`

## Usage

1. Download `torus-worm.py` file and store it in your computer.<br />
2. Open Autodesk Maya.<br />
3. Go to `Windows > General Editors > Script Editor`.<br />
4. Click on the `Python` label.<br />
5. Import the `torus-worm.py` file or copy-paste the code on the editor.<br />
6. Type `Ctrl + A` to select the whole text.<br />
7. Click on `Run` button, or `Ctrl + Enter` to execute the script.<br />

You can customize the variables commented as parameters inside the script to change between worm or flower, its height, its length, etc. By setting `flower` and `worm` variables to `False`, you can achieve a classic torus mesh. <br />

## Output

Personally, I like more how the flower option looks like, so I turned the `flower` parameters to `True` and saved the object created which looked like the following.<br />
